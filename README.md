# Buck_converter
A Buck Converter is the basic switched-mode power supply topology. Buck converter is a
DC-DC converter which will step down a higher voltage to a lower voltage level ,that means
output voltage magnitude is less than the input voltage magnitude.
The switching action can be implemented by a BJT, a
MOSFET, or an IGBT. In this project i used IGBT.
The DC input is given and uses pulse-width modulation (PWM) of switching frequency to
control the switch. An external diode, together with external inductor and output capacitor,
produces the regulated dc output. Buck, or step down converters produce an average output
voltage lower than the input source voltage.
